# licence-plate-recognition

What is this:
  This code is part of a larger project. So please don't judge him right now. It does recognise license plates characters and return as a list.

The idea: 
  The idea after this project is an automated garrage door opener.

How it works:
  Raspberry pi with a camera search for license plates. When it finds a licence plate, raspi calls "python" gods to use "OCR" black magic and it reads the plate. After a quick check if the plate is correct. Pi calls Arduino to send a input to the relay so the actuator can open the garage gate auotpmaticly
